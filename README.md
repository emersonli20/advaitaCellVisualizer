# advaitaCellVisualizer


## Background
Worked with Tim Huynh (Github @TimHuynh0905) as a team of 2.

Frontend Code: https://github.com/TimHuynh0905/cell_visualizer

Backend Code:https://github.com/TimHuynh0905/cell_visualizer_backend

## Overview:
- This application is meant to used by [scientific researchers in bioinformatics] to visualize the impact factors (a.k.a significance) of various cell components based on disease microarray data based on any disease. Broadly speaking, each component's impact factor. More information on impact factor can be found in this [paper]

## Instructions:
- Go to Advaita website to access their iPathway Guide
- Upload your csv file of microarray data to the iPathwayGuide [insert table]
- iPathwayGuide will output another csv file formatted with a p-value corresponding to each cell component [insert table]
- Create an account on https://advaita-cell-visualizer.web.app
- Upload your csv file to the cell visualizer companion app
